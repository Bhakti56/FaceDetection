# FaceDetection
Face Detection system using python is a real time application designed to detect and highlight human faces from a live webcam feed. The project was developed using python and opencv for image processing. The system leverages the Haar Cascade classifier, a pre-trained model for face detection, to identify facial regions in each photo.
